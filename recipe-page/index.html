        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <h4>MAKE THE ORANGE GLAZE</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by making the orange glaze. In a saucepan, combine the 
                coconut aminos, orange juice, rice vinegar, brown sugar, sesame 
                oil, garlic, ginger paste, and red pepper flakes. Bring it to a 
                gentle boil over medium heat. Then reduce the heat to low.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk together the water and cornstarch until 
                smooth. then slowly pour it into the bubbling sauce while 
                stirring.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Let it simmer for a few minutes until thick, glossy, and coats 
                the back of a spoon. Turn off the heat and set it aside while 
                you fry the chicken.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>BREADING & FRYING THE CHICKEN</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the boneless, skinless thighs into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large Ziploc bag, add the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, 
                salt, and black pepper. Seal the bag and shake it to mix 
                everything together.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a bowl, beat the eggs and season with salt and pepper. 
                Dip all the chicken pieces into the egg mixture, then transfer 
                them straight into the Ziploc bag.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Seal it up and shake it all around until every piece is fully 
                coated.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Heat a pot of vegetable oil over medium heat until it reaches 
                350°F. Fry the chicken in batches, making sure not to overcrowd 
                the pot. Cook each batch for about 5 to 6 minutes until golden, 
                crispy, and fully cooked through. Transfer to a wire rack or 
                paper towel-lined plate to drain.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once all the chicken is done, toss it in the warm orange glaze 
                until each piece is coated and glistening.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Sprinkle with sliced green onions and sesame seeds if you want, 
                then dig in while it’s hot and crispy!
            </li>
        </ol>

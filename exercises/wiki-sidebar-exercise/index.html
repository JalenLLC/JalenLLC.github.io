                        The Kawasaki Ninja H2 is a supercharged four-stroke 
                        supersport-class[13] motorcycle in the Ninja sports bike 
                        series manufactured by Kawasaki, featuring a 
                        variable-speed 
                        centrifugal supercharger.[14][15][16][17]

                    Its namesake is the 750 cc Kawasaki H2 Mach IV,[18][19] an 
                    inline triple that was introduced by Kawasaki in 1972 to 
                    "disrupt what it saw as a sleeping motorcycle market".[20]

                    Its Ninja H2R track-only variant is the fastest and most 
                    powerful production motorcycle on the market, producing a 
                    maximum of 310 horsepower (230 kW) and 326 horsepower 
                    (243 kW) with ram-air.[1] The H2R has 50% more power than 
                    the fastest street-legal motorcycles, while the street-legal 
                    Ninja H2 has a lower power output of 200 hp (150 kW)[21]–210 
                    hp (160 kW) with ram-air.[1]

                    Kawasaki selected the literbike platform for its 
                    top-of-the-line Ninja H2 model, rather than continuing with 
                    the higher-displacement Ninja ZX-14 hyperbike. Cycle World's 
                    Kevin Cameron explained that the literbike class is "the 
                    center of the high-performance market", attracting the best 
                    development in racing, with the best chassis and suspension 
                    design, so it made sense for Kawasaki to create a machine 
                    that could leverage this.[20]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The H2 is the first production motorcycle with a 
                    supercharger,[22] although turbochargers were available on 
                    some models in the early 1980s.

                    Specifications in the infobox are from Kawasaki unless 
                    noted.[23]

                    The street-legal Ninja H2 has mirrors in place of the 
                    track-only H2R's winglets,[21] and plastic body panels in 
                    place of the H2R's carbon-fiber panels but there is the H2 
                    carbon version that has them in carbon. The street-legal H2 
                    is said to make 200 horsepower (150 kW), probably with 
                    reduced supercharger boost compared to the H2R.[21] The H2 
                    and H2R share the supercharger (with a lower boost level on 
                    the H2) and many other components, with the exception of the 
                    head gasket, cam profile and timing with ECU mapping, 
                    exhaust system, and clutch (the H2R's clutch has two 
                    additional plates).[1]

                    For 2017, Kawasaki made a limited-edition model with 120 
                    units produced globally: the individually numbered Kawasaki 
                    Ninja H2 Carbon with special paint and carbon-fiber upper 
                    cowl. For 2017, the standard Ninja H2 was also updated.[24]
                </p>
                <p>
                    For 2018, Kawasaki made a new sport touring version of the 
                    H2, the Kawasaki H2 SX, with a claimed wet weight of 
                    256.1 kg (564.5 lb). Features that are options on the base 
                    model H2 SX come standard on the Kawasaki H2 SX SE, which 
                    has a claimed wet weight of 260.0 kg (573.3 lb).[25] It has 
                    revised throttle bodies, camshafts, crankshaft, pistons, 
                    cylinder and cylinder head as well as a new exhaust system 
                    aimed at increasing mid range torque. The intake system and 
                    supercharger impeller were also redesigned. A new larger 
                    fuel tank, rear trellis subframe and panniers increase the 
                    bike's weight by 19 pounds (8.6 kg).[26]
                </p>
                <p>
                    For 2019, the H2 received an update with 15% more power from 
                    updates to the intake, spark plugs, ECU, and air filter, 
                    among other components. Also added was a new LED lighting 
                    scheme and a special top coat of paint that is claimed to be 
                    self-healing and able to smooth over small scratches in 
                    warmer conditions. Also new were lighter and smaller Brembo 
                    Stylema calipers, a new TFT dash, and smartphone 
                    connectivity that provides information about the GPS route, 
                    speed, RPM, current gear, fuel mileage, fuel level, and 
                    odometer.[27][28] In addition, the 2019 Ninja H2 SX SE+ 
                    features electronically controlled suspension.[29]

                <p>
                    The H2's engine is a 998 cc (60.9 cu in) 4-valve, dual 
                    overhead cam inline-4 with a two-speed centrifugal 
                    supercharger.[30][31][32][33]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The supercharger is driven by a series of gears and shafts 
                    connecting the flywheel to a planetary drive, finally 
                    spinning a dog-shifted two-speed shaft attached to the 
                    impeller.[33] Throttle control is electronic.[34] A 
                    centrifugal supercharger has the advantage of generating 
                    less heat than other designs, especially scroll-type or 
                    screw-type superchargers.[33][22] Without an intercooler 
                    (which the H2 lacks), excess heat in the intake charge can 
                    cause pre-ignition that can damage or destroy the engine.

                    The H2 was announced by Kawasaki in a late-2014 teaser 
                    campaign, and was widely expected to be fully revealed at 
                    the Intermot motorcycle trade show the same year. Before 
                    full details were released by Kawasaki, the supercharged 
                    inline-4 engine[17] was thought by several industry 
                    observers to be identical to, or closely related to, a 
                    nearly 1,000 cc inline-4 with a centrifugal supercharger 
                    displayed by Kawasaki at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show.[15][b]

                </p>
                <p>
                    Cameron published an analysis showing that an engine of that 
                    displacement, mildly boosted at 5 psi (34 kPa), would 
                    generate 203 horsepower (151 kW)—more than that of 
                    Kawasaki's current leader, the 191.7-horsepower (143.0 kW)
                    [43] ZX-14 (horsepower figures are expressed at the rear 
                    wheel). The same engine would generate 257 horsepower 
                    (192 kW) with 10 psi (69 kPa) of pressure. His analysis 
                    included a discussion of the benefits of a two-speed 
                    supercharger for more linear power delivery (as opposed to 
                    the intractable Japanese turbo bikes of the 1980s that 
                    suffered from turbo lag). Cameron also said Kawasaki patent 
                    documents suggested the engine would rely on evaporative 
                    cooling using port fuel injection, instead of a bulky 
                    intercooler.[20]

                    Kawasaki claimed the 2013 model had the first supercharger 
                    designed by a motorcycle manufacturer.[44] In 2013, 
                    journalists said that the engine could power the "next 
                    generation [Ninja] ZX-14R" sportbike.[45] Journalists also 
                    noted that Kawasaki already has a production inline-4 
                    supercharged (albeit intercooled[46]) engine powering the 
                    Jet Ski Ultra 300X personal watercraft.[47]

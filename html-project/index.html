            Charlie Kenton used to be a prizefighter but lost his chance to win 
            a title when heavy, towering robots took over the boxing ring. Now 
            working as a small-time promoter, Charlie pieces together scrap 
            metal into low-end fighters, barely earning enough to make it from 
            one underground venue to the next. After hitting rock bottom, 
            Charlie reluctantly teams with his estranged son, Max, to build and 
            train a championship robot for a last shot at redemption.

            In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are 
            slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand 
            (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to 
            save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a 
            wormhole. But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper 
            (Matthew McConaughey) and a team of researchers through the wormhole 
            and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be 
            mankind's new home.

        <p>
            Trying to leave their troubled lives behind, twin brothers return to 
            their Mississippi hometown to start again, only to discover that an 
            even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back.The film uses the 
            vampire mythos as a metaphor for the historical and social issues of 
            the Jim Crow South, specifically focusing on the oppression faced by 
            Black people during that era. The vampires in the movie are 
            presented as outsiders who seek to assimilate and erase the identity 
            of the Black community, while simultaneously exploiting them for 
            their music and culture
